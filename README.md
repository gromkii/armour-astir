# How to use these sheets.
* Currently, the only way to use custom sheets in roll20 is with a premium account.
* Createa a new game, go to settings, and select custom character sheet.
* Copy and paste the contents of the HTML and CSS files into the appropriate spaces.

## Troubleshooting
* If upgrading to a newer version of the character sheet, it's much easier to just make a new sheet instead of converting an old one.
* Double check your spelling if things are populating! 
* If you don't see your playbook moves automatically populate, wait a few moments. It will occasionally take a bit to fully update.

## Questions or Comments?
* For questions about this character sheet, open an issue here on github.
